# Market::_computeClosingFactor wrong collateralization calculation can cause liquidatee solvency to become worse

## Summary
During a market liquidation, a closing factor is computed to ensure that enough of a liquidatee position is closed to make the liquidatee solvent again. However due to a wrong variable used in the calculation, the closing factor is wrongly computed and can lead to the solvency of a liquidatee to become worse after liquidation.

## Vulnerability Detail


Let's follow along the calculations made in the function _computeClosingFactor, and see how they impact repaid borrow amount and seized collateral.

First let's eval [diff](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/Market.sol#L325):
```solidity
collateralizationRate = 0.75
_liquidationMultiplier = 0.12
diff = collateralizationRate*_liquidationMultiplier = 0.84
```

This gives [x](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/Market.sol#L330) (repayable borrow):
```solidity
_liquidationCollateralizationRate = 0.8
1 / (1 - diff) = 6.25

x = repayableBorrow ~= (totalBorrowAmount - _liquidationCollateralizationRate*collateralInAsset) / (1 - diff) 
= (totalBorrowAmount - 0.8*collateralInAsset) * 6.25
```

### Before liquidation:
let's define X such as:
```solidity
let X = borrowAmount - 0.8*collateralInAsset 

CollateralOld = Cold
DebtOld = Dold = Cold * 0.8 + X

repayableBorrow = 6.25*X
```

### After liquidation:
```solidity
liquidationBonus = 1.1

seizedCollateral = repayableBorrow*liquidationBonus = 6.25*1.1*X

CollateralNew = Cnew = Cold - 6.25*1.1*X = Cold - 6.87X
DebtNew = Dnew = Dold - 6.25*X = (Cold * 0.8) + X - 6.25X = Cold*0.8 - 5.25X 
```

For the account to be solvent after liquidation, we want `DNew < 0.8 Cnew`:

```solidity
Dnew < 0.8 Cnew

Cold*0.8 - 5.25X < (Cold - 6.87X) * 0.8 

Cold - 6.56 X < Cold - 6.87 X 

Which is impossible if X > 0
```

## Impact
A position can not be fully liquidated, because closing factor is not big enough. This will leave unhealthy positions unliquidated and cause bad debt to the protocol

## Recommendation
Replace `collateralizationFactor` by `_liquidationCollateralizationFactor` when computing `diff`:

```diff
- uint256 diff =
-            (collateralizationRate * ((10 ** ratesPrecision) + _liquidationMultiplier)) / (10 ** ratesPrecision);
+ uint256 diff =
+            (_liquidationCollateralizationRate * ((10 ** ratesPrecision) + _liquidationMultiplier)) / (10 ** ratesPrecision);
```

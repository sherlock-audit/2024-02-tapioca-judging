# Unfair Liquidation Risk Due to Unvalidated Exchange Rate

## Summary
During liquidation events, the protocol relies on the [_updateOracleRateForLiquidations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/Market.sol#L427-L439) function to refresh exchange rates for accurate computations. However, this function fails to properly validate the exchange rate, potentially leading to unfair liquidations.

## Vulnerability Detail
During a liquidation, [_updateOracleRateForLiquidations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/Market.sol#L427-L439) is invoked to update the exchange rate to the latest rate, the updated exchange rate is then used for computations during the liquidation logic.

The problem here is that, [_updateOracleRateForLiquidations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/Market.sol#L427-L439) function doesn't ensure that the stored exchange rate is still a valid rate, when the Oracle wasn't updated `(i.e _updated = false)`:
```solidity
    function _updateOracleRateForLiquidations() internal {
        try oracle.get(oracleData) returns (bool _updated, uint256 _exchangeRate) {
            if (_updated && _exchangeRate > 0) {
                exchangeRate = _exchangeRate; //update cached rate
                rateTimestamp = block.timestamp;
            } else {
                _exchangeRate = exchangeRate; //use stored rate
                if (_exchangeRate == 0) revert ExchangeRateNotValid();
            }
        } catch {
            if (exchangeRate == 0) revert ExchangeRateNotValid();
        }
    }
```
And according to the protocol an exchange rate is only considered to be valid when 
`rateTimestamp + rateValidDuration >= block.timestamp,`, where the `rateValidDuration` is currently set to `24 hours`, so if the exchange rate hasn't been updated for longer than `24 hours`, the stored rate is considered to be an invalid rate.

## Impact
The use of outdated exchange rates could cause unfair liquidations, since a user could appear to be liquidatable when they aren't with the current rate.

## Recommendation
Use [updateExchangeRate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/Market.sol#L372-L385) function instead, to ensure the stored exchange rate will be a valid rate.

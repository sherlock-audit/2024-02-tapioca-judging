# `BBLiquidation.liquidteBadDebt()`, `BBLiquidation.liquidate()`, `SGLLiquidation.liquidateBadDebt()`, `SGLLiquidation.liquidate()`  might use stale exchangeRate for liquidations if oracle reverts for any reason.

## Summary
The issue lies in how the catch side of the try-catch block is handled.
## Vulnerability Detail
Here in `Market._updateOracleRateForLiquidations()` there's an issue with how the catch side of the try-catch block is handled.

```solidity
 function _updateOracleRateForLiquidations() internal {
        try oracle.get(oracleData) returns (bool _updated, uint256 _exchangeRate) {
            if (_updated && _exchangeRate > 0) {
                exchangeRate = _exchangeRate; //update cached rate
                rateTimestamp = block.timestamp;
            } else {
                _exchangeRate = exchangeRate; //use stored rate
                if (_exchangeRate == 0) revert ExchangeRateNotValid();
            }
        } catch {
            if (exchangeRate == 0) revert ExchangeRateNotValid();
        }
    }
```
The catch block only reverts if `exchangeRate` state var is 0, which won't  be effective considering the `exchangeRate` may have been updated before. 

1. Now the issue is that if the catch block runs for any reason it means  that the call  `try oracle.get(oracleData){` failed, so exchange rate won't be updated in these liquidation functions. Stale exchangeRate will be used in liquidations because the catch block won't revert if `exchangeRate` has been set previously

2. Also within the try block if update is false or _exchangeRate is 0 making the else statement run, _exchangeRate is set to exchangeRate state var  without checking its` rateTimestamp` against `rateValidDuration`.  so exchange rates that are beyond `rateValidDuration` could be used in liquidations too.
## Impact
`BBLiquidation.liquidteBadDebt()` , `BBLiquidation.liquidate()`, `SGLLiquidation.liquidateBadDebt()`, `SGLLiquidationliquidate()`  might use stale exchangeRate for liquidations if oracle reverts for any reason and no one may  even notice, considering that it doesn't revert

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. make the catch block of the try-catch used in _updateOracleRateForLiquidations() to revert when the call to oracle fails.
2. Also in the try block if update is false or _exchangeRate is 0 making the else statement run, check the ` rateTimestamp` of exchangeRate state var against `rateValidDuration` before setting _exchangeRate to exchangeRate state var

# Fees is deducted twice during native token wrapping

## Summary
During the wrapping of a native token with the `wrap` function on the `mTOFT` contract, more than needed value is spent which can cause DOS and incorrect accounting on the `mTOFT` contract though the value will be present in the vault contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Calling the wrap function found here with native token ie erc20 is address (0) https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/mTOFT.sol#L287 . It is expected to be called with some `msg.value` as it is a payable function and wants the `msg.value` amount wrapped. The msg.value is now part of the `TOFT` contract balance.

The `_checkAndExtractFees` internal function is called to extract the `feeAmount` as seen here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/mTOFT.sol#L300C29-L300C49

In the `_checkAndExtractFees` function, the `vault.registerFees{value: feeAmount}(feeAmount)` is called under the conditions that `feeAmount is > 0`, `mintFee > 0` and `_getChainId() != hostEid`. This means that a portion of the balance of the `TOFT` contract is used to call `vault.registerFees` and `feeAmount` is sent to the vault as seen in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/mTOFT.sol#L417

`_wrapNative` function is inherited from the `BaseTOFT` contract and this internal function is called https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/BaseTOFT.sol#L78

In the `_wrapNative` the amount is deposited in the vault and wrapped token is minted like 
`vault.depositNative{value: _amount}();
  _mint(_toAddress, _amount - _feeAmount);
  ` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/BaseTOFT.sol#L79
  

 Calculating, for an amount input say 1eth, and `mintFee` of `0.5%`, 0.005 eth is first transferred to the vault from `vault.registerFees{value: feeAmount}(feeAmount)`, 
 then 1eth is transferred with `depositNative` function, 
 and 0.995weth is minted though the `_mint` function. 
 
 This causes the `mTOFT` contract to lose 1.005 eth to the vault through deposit instead of 1eth for 0.995weth minted
 This logic is different for non-native tokens, 1 ethEquiv is deposited to the vault and 0.995 worth of wrapped tokens is gotten back, which indicates logic incompatibilty. In the non-native token wrapping logic, 1 eth is sent to the vault and 0.995weth is minted with the `feeAmount` already taken care of.
 
## Impact

Medium impact, as it can cause DOS if the balance of the TOFT contract at a time is less than `amount+feeAmount` deposited instead of assumed `amount` it will cause a revert.

It can also cause incorrect accounting as every time native tokens are wrapped, double the `feeAmount` is paid, which means an extra `feeAmount` is sent to the vault during registration and another deducted during wrapping, making the accounted native token balance of the `mTOFT` contract drop by `feeAmount` on each `wrap` call and the `_fees` recorded by `TOFTVault` less than received, and cause unexpected issue for the contracts, though the fees can always be transferred back through the `transferFees` function to revert this issue.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _checkAndExtractFees(uint256 _amount) private returns (uint256 feeAmount) {
        feeAmount = 0;

        // not on host chain; extract fee
        // fees are used to rebalance liquidity to host chain
        if (_getChainId() != hostEid && mintFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * mintFee) / 1e5;
            if (feeAmount > 0) {
                if (erc20 == address(0)) {
                    vault.registerFees{value: feeAmount}(feeAmount);
                } else {
                    vault.registerFees(feeAmount);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    function _wrapNative(address _toAddress, uint256 _amount, uint256 _feeAmount) internal virtual {
        vault.depositNative{value: _amount}();
        _mint(_toAddress, _amount - _feeAmount);
    }
    
    function depositNative() external payable onlyOwner {
        if (!_isNative) revert NotValid();
        if (msg.value == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
    }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Register the fee in the vault without sending `msg.value` as the `feeAmount` will be deducted during the `_wrapNative` because `_amount - _feeAmount` will be minted and `_amount` deposited, accounting for the `_feeAmount` added to the vault though the `registerFees` function.

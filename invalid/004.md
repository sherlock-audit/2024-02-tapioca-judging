# Liquidation Imbalance and Collateral Discrepancy in Smart Contract

## Summary
The function **_updateBorrowAndCollateralShare** in the given smart contract contains a vulnerability where it fails to validate that the collateralShare to be reduced from a user's account during liquidation does not exceed the user's actual **userCollateralShare[user]**. This oversight can lead to a liquidation imbalance, where the reduction in collateral is not proportional to the user's debt, potentially allowing the user's collateral to be incorrectly reduced to a negative value (in the absence of **SafeMath**) or to zero (with **SafeMath**).
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the "Liquidation Imbalance and Collateral Discrepancy in Smart Contract" vulnerability in the provided code is that the function **_updateBorrowAndCollateralShare** does not handle the possibility of negative values for **borrowPart** and **collateralShare** when subtracting them from **userBorrowPart**[user] and **userCollateralShare[user]** respectively on lines 293 and 294.

If the calculated **borrowPart** or **collateralShare** is greater than the corresponding values stored in **userBorrowPart[user]** or **userCollateralShare[user]**, the subtraction operation will result in a negative value, which is not handled in the code. This can lead to an imbalance in the liquidation process and a discrepancy in the collateral held by the user.

The vulnerability in the provided code lies in the function _updateBorrowAndCollateralShare where the borrower's borrowPart and collateralShare are updated without proper validation. This can lead to a situation where the borrower's borrowPart and collateralShare become negative, causing an imbalance in the liquidation process.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) public userBorrowPart;
    mapping(address => uint256) public userCollateralShare;

    function _updateBorrowAndCollateralShare(
        address user,
        uint256 maxBorrowPart,
        uint256 minLiquidationBonus,
        uint256 _exchangeRate
    ) private returns (uint256 borrowAmount, uint256 borrowPart, uint256 collateralShare) {
        borrowPart = 100; // Setting borrowPart to a fixed value for demonstration
        collateralShare = 50; // Setting collateralShare to a fixed value for demonstration

        userBorrowPart[user] -= borrowPart; // Vulnerability: borrowPart can become negative
        userCollateralShare[user] -= collateralShare; // Vulnerability: collateralShare can become negative

        return (borrowAmount, borrowPart, collateralShare);
    }

    function exploit() public {
        address attacker = msg.sender;
        userBorrowPart[attacker] = 50; // Borrow part for the attacker
        userCollateralShare[attacker] = 20; // Collateral share for the attacker

        // Calling the vulnerable function
        _updateBorrowAndCollateralShare(attacker, 200, 0, 1);

        // Now the attacker's borrowPart and collateralShare will be negative
        // This can lead to an imbalance in the liquidation process
    }
}
```
In the PoC code, the exploit function demonstrates how an attacker can manipulate the **userBorrowPart** and **userCollateralShare** values to exploit the vulnerability in the **_updateBorrowAndCollateralShare** function. This manipulation can lead to an imbalance in the liquidation process, potentially causing financial loss or instability in the smart contract.
## Impact
This could cause operational issues, affect the protocol's solvency, and undermine the integrity of the liquidation process.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code lies in lines 293 and 294 where the borrower's borrowPart and collateralShare are updated without checking if the user has enough balance to cover the deduction. This can lead to a situation where the borrower's borrowPart or collateralShare becomes negative, causing an imbalance in the liquidation process and potentially disrupting the smart contract's functionality.

To fix this issue, we need to add a check to ensure that the borrower's borrowPart and collateralShare are not deducted below zero. If the deduction would result in a negative value, the function should revert and throw an error to prevent the imbalance.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to address the vulnerability:

```solidity
function _updateBorrowAndCollateralShare(
    address user,
    uint256 maxBorrowPart,
    uint256 minLiquidationBonus,
    uint256 _exchangeRate
) private returns (uint256 borrowAmount, uint256 borrowPart, uint256 collateralShare) {
    (borrowAmount, borrowPart, collateralShare) = _viewLiqudationBorrowAndCollateralShare(
        _ViewLiquidationStruct(
            user,
            maxBorrowPart,
            minLiquidationBonus,
            _exchangeRate,
            yieldBox,
            collateralId,
            userCollateralShare[user],
            userBorrowPart[user],
            totalBorrow,
            liquidationBonusAmount,
            liquidationCollateralizationRate,
            liquidationMultiplier,
            EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION,
            FEE_PRECISION_DECIMALS
        )
    );

    require(userBorrowPart[user] >= borrowPart, "Insufficient borrowPart balance");
    require(userCollateralShare[user] >= collateralShare, "Insufficient collateralShare balance");

    userBorrowPart[user] -= borrowPart;
    userCollateralShare[user] -= collateralShare;
}
```
By adding the **require** statements to check if the borrower has enough balance before deducting **borrowPart** and **collateralShare**, we ensure that the liquidation process remains balanced and prevent any discrepancies in the smart contract.

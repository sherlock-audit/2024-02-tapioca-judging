# computeTotalDebt() from the Penrose.sol uses the "&&" operator instead of the "||" operator in its require statement.

## Summary
computeTotalDebt() from the Penrose.sol uses the "&&" operator instead of the "||" operator in its require statement. Therefore it fails to accept individual calls from either the registered Markets, owner or Penrose contract address itself.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the Natspec describing the  computeTotalDebt() function, The require statement should only check for only one of registered market address, the owner of the contract address  or the penrose contract address itself to proceed with fulfilling the purpose of the function, but instead the require statement mandates that all three parameters be met before total debts could be computed. 
Because of this the contract fails to deliver expected function and reverts if the msg.sender doesn't passes all three requirements.

## Impact
Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/Penrose.sol#L517-L532

the below function takes the "&&"  operator instead of the "|| " in its require statement
```solidity
    function computeTotalDebt() public notPaused returns (uint256 totalUsdoDebt) {
        // allow other registered Markets, owner or Penrose to call it
        if (!isMarketRegistered[msg.sender] && msg.sender != owner() && msg.sender != address(this)) {
            revert NotAuthorized();
        }

        //accrue to the latest point in time
        _reAccrueMarkets(true);

        // compute debt
        totalUsdoDebt = viewTotalDebt();

        emit TotalUsdoDebt(totalUsdoDebt);
    }
```
## Tool used
Vs code, Manual Review

## POC

- Register a singularity market address which is not a prior owner of the the penrose contract.

- Call the  computeTotalDebt() to get the total debt amount

- the function reverts because the computeTotalDebt() function requires a caller to also be the owner of the contract.

## Recommendation
change the "&&" operator in the computeTotalDebt() to "||" to allow access for either of the three authorized addresses.
```solidity
    if (!isMarketRegistered[msg.sender] || msg.sender != owner() || msg.sender != address(this)) {
            revert NotAuthorized();
        }
```

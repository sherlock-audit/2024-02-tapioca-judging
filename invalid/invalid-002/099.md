# _internalTransferWithAllowance() users can use multi-signature wallets that do not belong to them under different chains.

## Summary
Currently, many users possess multi-signature wallets. 
Due to the mechanism for generating multi-signature addresses
the same address might not be controlled by the same user on different chains. 
However, the `_internalTransferWithAllowance()` function only verifies `_owner != srcChainSender` for allowance checks. 
As a result, users on Chain A can manipulate the same address's assets belonging to a different user's account on Chain B.

## Vulnerability Detail
Several contracts currently rely on `_internalTransferWithAllowance()` to the allowance security check 
```solidity
    function _internalTransferWithAllowance(address _owner, address srcChainSender, uint256 _amount) internal {
        if (_owner != srcChainSender) {
            _spendAllowance(_owner, srcChainSender, _amount);
        }

        _transfer(_owner, address(this), _amount);
    }
```

If `from == srcChainSender`, this method can be directly used. don't check allowance

Let's consider a scenario where the same allowance wallet address `0x123` belongs to Alice on Chain A but is belongs to Bob on Chain B.

In this case, Alice can execute `usdo.lzCompose(_dstEid=B)` to bypass the allowance security check and manipulate Bob's balance on Chain B.

There are multiple instances where allowance checks can be bypassed, including:
- `Usdo._remoteTransferReceiver`
- `Usdo.exerciseOptionsReceiver`
- `TOFTGenericReceiverModule.receiveWithParamsReceiver`
...

## Impact

Users can use the multi-signed wallet balance that does not belong to them under different chains.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended that if `_owner` is not EOA (`code.length > 0`), the same allowance check should be performed to ensure security.

```diff
    function _internalTransferWithAllowance(address _owner, address srcChainSender, uint256 _amount) internal {
-       if (_owner != srcChainSender) {
+       // check code for ensure the safety of multi-signature wallet cross-chain.
+       if (_owner != srcChainSender || _owner.code.length !=0) {
            _spendAllowance(_owner, srcChainSender, _amount);
        }

        _transfer(_owner, address(this), _amount);
    }
```

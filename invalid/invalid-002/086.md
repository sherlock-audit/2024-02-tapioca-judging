# Handling the case where `msg_.unwrap` == false is missed in the `TOFTGenericReceiverModule.receiveWithParamsReceiver` function

## Summary
See Vulnerability Detail
## Vulnerability Detail
`TOFTGenericReceiverModule.receiveWithParamsReceiver` function is used to transfer received tokens to `msg_.receiver`. However, this function only attempts to transfer tokens in the case where `msg_.unwrap` is true. If `msg_.unwrap` is false, it doesn't do anything.
```solidity=
function receiveWithParamsReceiver(address srcChainSender, bytes memory _data) public payable {
    SendParamsMsg memory msg_ = TOFTMsgCodec.decodeSendParamsMsg(_data);

    msg_.amount = _toLD(msg_.amount.toUint64());

    if (msg_.unwrap) {
        ITOFT tOFT = ITOFT(address(this));
        address toftERC20 = tOFT.erc20();

        /// @dev xChain owner needs to have approved dst srcChain `sendPacket()` msg.sender in a previous composedMsg. Or be the same address.
        _internalTransferWithAllowance(msg_.receiver, srcChainSender, msg_.amount);
        tOFT.unwrap(address(this), msg_.amount);

        if (toftERC20 != address(0)) {
            IERC20(toftERC20).safeTransfer(msg_.receiver, msg_.amount);
        } else {
            (bool sent,) = msg_.receiver.call{value: msg_.amount}("");
            if (!sent) revert TOFTGenericReceiverModule_TransferFailed();
        }
    }
}
```
## Impact

## Recommendation
Should also consider the case where `msg_.unwrap` is false

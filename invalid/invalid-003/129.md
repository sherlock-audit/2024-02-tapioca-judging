# Borrowing can exceed the maximum amount

## Summary

The borrow function can borrow money multiple times. The amount that can be borrowed can exceed the limit.

## Vulnerability Detail

When calculating the borrow function, the value of the current collateral is calculated through `_computeAllowanceAmountInAsset`, but the current borrowed balance is not checked. Therefore, the user can bypass the maximum borrowing amount by borrowing multiple times.

```solidity
    function borrow(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
        external
        optionNotPaused(PauseType.Borrow)
        notSelf(to)
        solvent(from, false)
        returns (uint256 part, uint256 share)
    {
        if (amount == 0) return (0, 0);
        penrose.reAccrueBigBangMarkets();

        uint256 feeAmount = _computeVariableOpeningFee(amount);
        uint256 allowanceShare =
            _computeAllowanceAmountInAsset(from, exchangeRate, amount + feeAmount, asset.safeDecimals());
        if (allowanceShare == 0) revert AllowanceNotValid();
        _allowedBorrow(from, allowanceShare);
        (part, share) = _borrow(from, to, amount, feeAmount);
    }
```



## Impact

The amount that users can borrow far exceeds that of collateral

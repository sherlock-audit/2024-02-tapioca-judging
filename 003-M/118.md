# Missing pausing functionality implementation makes USDO, tOFT and AssetToSGLPLeverageExecutor contracts not pausable

## Summary

Contracts who inherit from OpenZeppelin's pausable contract lack the actual implementations to pause the contracts, rendering them unpausable

## Vulnerability Detail

The `USDO.sol`, `TOFT.sol` and `AssetToSGLPLeverageExecutor.sol` contracts inherit from Openzeppelin’s Pausable contract. 

OpenZeppelin’s Pausable contract offers the functionality of pausing via the `whenNotPaused()` modifier. However, this contract does not have any external function that allows contracts inheriting Pausable to actually pause/unpause the contract, and the contract will not be pausable by simply inheriting Pausable, as stated in [OpenZeppelin’s comments](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Pausable.sol#L14-L15).

This will make both contracts unpausable, which might be an important feature if unexpected events affect the protocol.

## Impact

Medium. Contract’s won’t be pausable and might be affected in market downturns/unexpected events affecting USDO and the Tapioca protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement functions that allow the pausing state to be set/unset, so that USDO.sol, TOFT.sol and AssetToSGLPLeverageExecutor.sol can actually be pausable.

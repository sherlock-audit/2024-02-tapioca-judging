# BigBang/Singularity::_updateBorrowAndCollateralShare totalBorrow variable is never updated and breaks a few core mechanics

## Summary

When liquidating users, their individual borrow share is reduced, however the variable tracking `totalBorrow` is not updated.
This breaks the accounting for a few core mechanisms 

## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see in the function `_updateBorrowAndCollateralShare`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/bigBang/BBLiquidation.sol#L166-L228

the variable totalBorrow is never updated, as done in `liquidateBadDebt`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/bigBang/BBLiquidation.sol#L85-L86 

Which means that the `debtRate` used to accrue interest, is incorrectly increased or decreased depending on if the market is eth big bang or not:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/bigBang/BBCommon.sol#L49

Also the rewards sent to twTap are going to be reduced as a result:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/Penrose.sol#L277-L301

However individual borrows should not be impacted, since their borrow share ratios remain the same

## Impact

Incorrect interest rate applied to borrows on BigBang markets, reduced rewards distributed to twTap in penrose.

## Recommendation
Remove the repaid debt from global variable `totalBorrow`

# Liquidation without bad debt doesn't update totalBorrow of market

## Summary
During a liquidation of BigBang or Singularity contract, it doesn't update the `totalBorrow` although it still updates the borrow storage (`userBorrowPart`) of user.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `_liquidateUser()` function of BBLiquidation contract, it get liquidated borrow amount and collateral share from `_updateBorrowAndCollateralShare`, then updates`totalCollateralShare`. 
```solidity=
function _liquidateUser(
    ...
) private {
    uint256 callerReward = _getCallerReward(user, _exchangeRate);

    (uint256 borrowAmount,, uint256 collateralShare) =
        _updateBorrowAndCollateralShare(user, maxBorrowPart, minLiquidationBonus, _exchangeRate);
    totalCollateralShare = totalCollateralShare > collateralShare ? totalCollateralShare - collateralShare : 0;

    ...
```
However, during the liquidation, `totalBorrow` isn't updated even though `userBorrowPart` was updated in the `_updateBorrowAndCollateralShare` function ([code snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/bigBang/BBLiquidation.sol#L226-L227)). 
It's a serious mistake since totalBorrow is intentionally updated in the `liquidateBadDebt()` function ([code snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/singularity/SGLLiquidation.sol#L96-L97)).

The same vulnerability exists in SGLLiquidation.
## Impact
This issue results in incorrect totalBorrow for markets, which can become very large and reach borrow cap faster. The calculation of borrowing and undercollateralization will be incorrect, leading to inaccurate market states and unexpected losses for users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update `totalBorrow` in `_liquidateUser` function as the following:
```solidity=
(uint256 borrowAmount,, uint256 collateralShare) =
        _updateBorrowAndCollateralShare(user, maxBorrowPart, minLiquidationBonus, _exchangeRate);
uint256 borrowPart = totalBorrow.toBase(borrowAmount, false);
totalBorrow.elastic -= borrowAmount;
totalBorrow.base -= borrowPart;
```

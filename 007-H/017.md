# Flaw in Cross-Chain Approval System Raises Risk of Unauthorized Token Transfers

## Summary
When [TOFTOptionsReceiverModule::exerciseOptionsReceiver](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/modules/TOFTOptionsReceiverModule.sol#L142-L182) is invoked during a composed `cross-chain` call, in the case when the owner in the `destination chain` isn't the same as the `source chain` sender, the requirement that the owner has given the `source chain` sender prior approval up to the payment amount in the `destination/current chain`, opens up the risk of the owner approving an address not controlled by the same user in the `source chain`.
## Vulnerability Detail
[TOFTOptionsReceiverModule::exerciseOptionsReceiver](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/modules/TOFTOptionsReceiverModule.sol#L142-L182) module is a module that enables users to exercise their `mTOFT` tokens for a given amount of `tapOFT` option tokens.
This module achieves this by:
+ Retrieving the passed-in payment token amount into the contract
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/modules/TOFTOptionsReceiverModule.sol#L155-L156
+ Giving the option target approval to spend the retrieved payment token amount
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/modules/TOFTOptionsReceiverModule.sol#L158-L163
+ Sending the received `tapOFT` to the passed-in user
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/modules/TOFTOptionsReceiverModule.sol#L204-L205

```solidity
    function _internalTransferWithAllowance(address _owner, address srcChainSender, uint256 _amount) internal {
        if (_owner != srcChainSender) {
            _spendAllowance(_owner, srcChainSender, _amount);
        }

        _transfer(_owner, address(this), _amount);
    }
```
The problem with the current implementation is that, the [_internalTransferWithAllowance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/modules/TOFTOptionsReceiverModule.sol#L278-L283) function expects when the owner in the `current chain` isn't the same as the `source chain` sender, that the `current chain` owner to have given the `source chain` sender in this `chain` an allowance up to the amount to be transferred, which could be problematic when the `source chain` sender address in the `current chain` and the `source chain` isn't controlled by the same `user`, this could lead to unauthorized token transfers.

## Impact
Approving an address that isn't controlled by the same user in a `different chain`, could result in the owner getting drained

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I will recommend approving the destination chain `mTOFT` contract address instead, can also use `Pearlmit` to give a timed approval in a prior composed message.

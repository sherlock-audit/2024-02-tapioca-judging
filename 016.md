# BBLeverage.buyCollateral() and BBLendingCommon._repay() will have issues withdrawing from yieldBox for `from`

## Summary
access control was implemented on yieldbox's withdraw() function
```solidity
 function withdraw(
        uint256 assetId,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 share
    ) public allowed(from) returns (uint256 amountOut, uint256 shareOut) {
```
## Vulnerability Detail
 it seems withdrawals from the yieldbox will be impossible when your contracts try to withdraw for another person as there's some kind of access control implemented on it.

```solidity
/// Modifier to check if the msg.sender is allowed to use funds belonging to the 'from' address.
    /// If 'from' is msg.sender, it's allowed.
    /// If 'msg.sender' is an address (an operator) that is approved by 'from', it's allowed.
    modifier allowed(address from) {
        _requireTransferAllowed(from);
        _;
    }
```
The above modifier won't let `BBLendingCommon` and `BBLeverage` withdraw funds for `from` , if `from` doesn't set them as an operator for his account.

This also affects YieldBox.transfer() done in [`_addCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/origins/Origins.sol#L265) 

## Impact
withdrawals from the yieldbox will be impossible if `from` doesn't set `BBLendingCommon` and `BBLeverage` as operators for his account.

BBLeverage.buyCollateral() and BBLendingCommon._repay() will have issues withdrawing from yieldBox for `from`

Also YieldBox.transfer() done in Origins._addCollateral() will encounter similar problems if `from` doesn't set Origins.sol as an operator 
 for his account.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
look for a way to have `from` approve `BBLendingCommon` and `BBLeverage` as operators for his account directly in the yieldBox from your codebase

# Multiple lzCompose messages did not verify the legality of _srcChainSender

## Summary
In the current protocol, several modules only require the `_toeComposeMsg` to execute. However, there is no validation of the legality of `_srcChainSender`. 
As a result, anyone can construct a `_toeComposeMsg` to execute arbitrary `lzCompose` information.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's take `TOFTMarketReceiverModule.marketRemoveCollateralReceiver` as an example. 
This module's parameter is only `_data = _toeComposeMsg`.

```solidity
function marketRemoveCollateralReceiver(bytes memory _data) public payable {
    /// @dev decode received message
    MarketRemoveCollateralMsg memory msg_ = TOFTMsgCodec.decodeMarketRemoveCollateralMsg(_data);
}
```

Without passing `_srcChainSender` and validating its legitimacy, anyone can front-run construct a `compose msg` for execution.

>If `permit` information for `v`, `r`, and `s` is required for composing, it can be obtained from the mempool.

## Impact

The lack of a `_srcChainSender` security check allows anyone to modify the `compose msg` for execution.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended that all modules check `_srcChainSender`. For instance, consider adding something similar to `_internalTransferWithAllowance(msg_.receiver, srcChainSender, msg_.amount);`. This recommendation applies to modules such as:

- TOFTMarketReceiver
- UsdoMarketReceiver
- TOFTOptionsReceiver

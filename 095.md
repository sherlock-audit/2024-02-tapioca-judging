# Griefing Attack on TOFT and mTOFT contract deployment

## Summary

The `TOFTVault` is deployed and ownership transferred to zero address, then the `mTOFT` or `TOFT` is expected to claim ownership of the vault on deployment, but the delay between the deployment of the vault and claiming of ownership of vault can be exploited and an attacker claim ownership by frontrunning the `TOFT` contract deployment, causing the deployment to revert but expensive gas fee still paid.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the constructor of the `TOFTVault` the ownership of the vault is transferred to the address 0 as seen at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/TOFTVault.sol#L43

The claimOwnership function has no access control and anyone can call the function as seen at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/TOFTVault.sol#L73

It is expected that `TOFT` claims the vault ownership here at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/TOFT.sol#L83

But the time difference between the two contract deployments opens up the possibility of an attacker monitoring the mempool to call the `claimOwnership` function ahead of the `TOFT` contract deployment fulfillment. Though this causes no loss of funds, the contract deployment fails and the expensive deployment gas fee is still spent, causing grief to the team on the deployment of the `TOFT` or `mTOFT` contract. Deploying another `TOFTVault` and repeating the same process yields the same result

## Impact

Medium Impact as it causes no huge loss of funds except the ones spent on gas but can cause grief on the project by delaying the launch and deployment of the `TOFT` smart contract

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 /// @dev Intended to be called once by the TOFT contract
    function claimOwnership() external {
        if (owner() != address(0)) revert OwnerSet();
        _transferOwnership(msg.sender);
    }
    
    
    constructor(TOFTInitStruct memory _tOFTData, TOFTModulesInitStruct memory _modulesData)
        BaseTOFT(_tOFTData)
        ERC20Permit(_tOFTData.name)
    {
        // Set TOFT execution modules
        if (_modulesData.tOFTSenderModule == address(0)) revert TOFT_NotValid();
        if (_modulesData.tOFTReceiverModule == address(0)) {
            revert TOFT_NotValid();
        }
        if (_modulesData.marketReceiverModule == address(0)) {
            revert TOFT_NotValid();
        }
        if (_modulesData.optionsReceiverModule == address(0)) {
            revert TOFT_NotValid();
        }
        if (_modulesData.genericReceiverModule == address(0)) {
            revert TOFT_NotValid();
        }

        _setModule(uint8(ITOFT.Module.TOFTSender), _modulesData.tOFTSenderModule);
        _setModule(uint8(ITOFT.Module.TOFTReceiver), _modulesData.tOFTReceiverModule);
        _setModule(uint8(ITOFT.Module.TOFTMarketReceiver), _modulesData.marketReceiverModule);
        _setModule(uint8(ITOFT.Module.TOFTOptionsReceiver), _modulesData.optionsReceiverModule);
        _setModule(uint8(ITOFT.Module.TOFTGenericReceiver), _modulesData.genericReceiverModule);

        vault = IToftVault(_tOFTData.vault);
        vault.claimOwnership();

        if (address(vault._token()) != erc20) revert TOFT_VaultWrongERC20();
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review, Forge

## Recommendation
Instead of claiming ownership on contract deployment, deploy the TOFT contract and have an `admin/onlyOwner` function transfer ownership to the newly deployed `TOFT` contract with `_transferOwnership`. This is done once and ownership of the vault is successfully transferred.

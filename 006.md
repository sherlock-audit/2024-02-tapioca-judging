# Potential Precision Error Leads to Inflated Collateral Value and Erroneous Solvency Determination

## Summary
The **_isSolvent** function in the given smart contract is potentially vulnerable to precision errors during collateralization calculations. These errors could arise from the improper handling or setting of the **EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION** and **FEE_PRECISION** constants. If these constants are not accurately defined, the resulting collateral value can be miscalculated, leading to an inflated appraisal of collateral worth. This misrepresentation could permit users to borrow more funds than their collateral justifies, thereby endangering the financial integrity of the protocol. If multiple users exploit this vulnerability, it could culminate in a systemic **undercollateralization**, escalating to protocol insolvency.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the "Potential Precision Error Leads to Inflated Collateral Value and Erroneous Solvency Determination" vulnerability in the provided code is the improper handling of precision in the calculation on line 476.

In the calculation on line 476, the **collateralAmount** is multiplied by (**EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION / FEE_PRECISION**) without considering the precision of the variables involved. This can lead to a potential precision error where the collateral value is inflated due to incorrect precision handling.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can manipulate the collateralShare and borrowPart values in such a way that the calculation in line 476 results in a value that is significantly higher than the actual borrow amount. This can trick the system into believing that the user is solvent when they are actually not.

Proof of Concept (PoC) code:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ExploitContract {
    uint256 public borrowPart;
    uint256 public collateralShare;
    uint256 public exchangeRate = 1000; // Example exchange rate

    function setBorrowPart(uint256 _borrowPart) public {
        borrowPart = _borrowPart;
    }

    function setCollateralShare(uint256 _collateralShare) public {
        collateralShare = _collateralShare;
    }

    function isSolvent() public view returns (bool) {
        uint256 collateralAmount = collateralShare; // Simplified for demonstration
        uint256 totalBorrow = 1000; // Example total borrow amount
        uint256 EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION = 1000; // Example exchange rate precision
        uint256 FEE_PRECISION = 1000; // Example fee precision

        return collateralAmount * (EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION / FEE_PRECISION) * exchangeRate >= (borrowPart * totalBorrow * exchangeRate);
    }
}
```
In this PoC code, an attacker can set the **borrowPart** and **collateralShare** values to manipulate the solvency check in the **isSolvent** function. By adjusting these values, the attacker can make the system incorrectly determine solvency, leading to potential exploits.

## Impact
The vulnerability's impact could be magnified during liquidation events, as the different collateralization rate (**liquidationCollateralizationRate** versus **collateralizationRate**) might further skew the collateral value calculations. This flaw is particularly critical because it directly affects the protocolâ€™s ability to assess and maintain solvency, potentially resulting in significant financial loss and erosion of user trust.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, we should move the division by (EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION / FEE_PRECISION) to the other side of the comparison on line 478. This will ensure that the calculation maintains the necessary precision and accuracy.

Here is the patched code example:

```solidity
466       function _isSolvent(address user, uint256 _exchangeRate, bool _liquidation) internal view returns (bool) {
467           // accrue must have already been called!
468           uint256 borrowPart = userBorrowPart[user];
469           if (borrowPart == 0) return true;
470           uint256 collateralShare = userCollateralShare[user];
471           if (collateralShare == 0) return false;
472   
473           Rebase memory _totalBorrow = totalBorrow;
474   
475           uint256 collateralAmount = yieldBox.toAmount(collateralId, collateralShare, false);
476           return collateralAmount
477               * (_liquidation ? liquidationCollateralizationRate : collateralizationRate)
478               * _totalBorrow.elastic * _exchangeRate
479               >= (borrowPart * _totalBorrow.base * FEE_PRECISION) / EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION;
480       }
```
By moving the division to the other side of the comparison, we ensure that the calculation maintains precision and accuracy, thus fixing the potential precision error vulnerability.

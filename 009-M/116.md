# Leverage module’s buyCollateral()  function will always fail due to wrong parameter when depositing into yieldbox

## Summary

Passing a wrong parameter when depositing into YieldBox will make calls to `buyCollateral()` always fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `buyCollateral()` feature in the BigBang and Singularity’s leverage module allows users to borrow more USDO and immediately set it as collateral. The summarized steps performed inside`buyCollateral()` are:

1. Withdraw USDO deposited from caller in YieldBox and transfer the USDO to the leverage executor
2. Borrow USDO (by default deposited in YieldBox), withdraw it from YieldBox and transfer it to the leverage executor
3. Swap the USDO for the collateral asset via the leverage executor
4. Deposit the collateral into YieldBox (this is the wrong step detailed in this vulnerability). 
5. Trigger `_addCollateral()` so that the deposited YieldBox collateral assets are used as actual collateral in USDO  

The problem with this vulnerability relies in step 4. As we can see in the following code snippet, after swapping the USDO for the collateral asset, the collateral is deposited into YieldBox. The problem is that the `yieldBox.depositAsset()` specifies that the shares obtained after depositing into YieldBox will be received by `address(this)` (the BBLeverage/SGLLeverage contract), instead of the `calldata_.from` address. Because the leverage contract is the one receiving the YieldBox shares, the final `_addCollateral()` call will fail (this call tries to pull the YieldBox share tokens from the user (`calldata_.from`), but the leverage module contract is the actual address that has the shares).

```solidity
// BBLeverage.sol (also applies to SGLLeverage.sol)

function buyCollateral(address from, uint256 borrowAmount, uint256 supplyAmount, bytes calldata data) 
        external
        optionNotPaused(PauseType.LeverageBuy)
        solvent(from, false)
        notSelf(from)  
        returns (uint256 amountOut) 
    { 
        ...
        uint256 collateralShare = yieldBox.toShare(collateralId, amountOut, false);
        address(asset).safeApprove(address(yieldBox), type(uint256).max); 
  
        
        yieldBox.depositAsset(collateralId, address(this), address(this), 0, collateralShare); 
        address(asset).safeApprove(address(yieldBox), 0); 
 
         if (collateralShare == 0) revert CollateralShareNotValid();
        _allowedBorrow(calldata_.from, collateralShare);
        _addCollateral(calldata_.from, calldata_.from, false, 0, collateralShare); 
    } 
```

This will make `buyCollateral()` always fail because `calldata_.from` will never receive the YieldBox shares and a lack of balance will make the collateral addition always revert.

## Impact

High. buyCollateral() will always fail and this feature will be unusable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to set the `calldata_.from` to be the receiver of the YieldBox deposit shares, instead of `address(this)`:

```diff
// BBLeverage.sol (also applies to SGLLeverage.sol)

function buyCollateral(address from, uint256 borrowAmount, uint256 supplyAmount, bytes calldata data) 
        external
        optionNotPaused(PauseType.LeverageBuy)
        solvent(from, false)
        notSelf(from)  
        returns (uint256 amountOut) 
    { 
        ...
        uint256 collateralShare = yieldBox.toShare(collateralId, amountOut, false);
        address(asset).safeApprove(address(yieldBox), type(uint256).max); 
  
        
-        yieldBox.depositAsset(collateralId, address(this), address(this), 0, collateralShare); 
+        yieldBox.depositAsset(collateralId, address(this), calldata_.from, 0, collateralShare); 
        address(asset).safeApprove(address(yieldBox), 0); 
 
         if (collateralShare == 0) revert CollateralShareNotValid();
        _allowedBorrow(calldata_.from, collateralShare);
        _addCollateral(calldata_.from, calldata_.from, false, 0, collateralShare); 
    }
```

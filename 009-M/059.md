# The repaying action in `BBLeverage.sellCollateral` function pulls YieldBox shares of asset from wrong address

## Summary
The `sellCollateral` function is used to sell a user's collateral to obtain YieldBox shares of the asset and repay the user's loan. However, in the BBLeverage contract, it calls `_repay` with the `from` parameter set to the user, even though the asset shares have already been collected by this contract beforehand.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `BBLeverage.sellCollateral`, the `from` variable (user)  is used as the repayer address.
```solidity=
if (memoryData.shareOwed <= memoryData.shareOut) {
    _repay(from, from, memoryData.partOwed);
} else {
    //repay as much as we can
    uint256 partOut = totalBorrow.toBase(amountOut, false);
    _repay(from, from, partOut);
}
```
Therefore, asset shares of user will be pulled in `BBLendingCommon._repay` function.
```solidity=
function _repay(address from, address to, uint256 part) internal returns (uint256 amount) {
    ...
    // @dev amount includes the opening & accrued fees
    yieldBox.withdraw(assetId, from, address(this), amount, 0);
    ...
```
This is incorrect behavior since the necessary asset shares were already collected by the contract in the `BBLeverage.sellCollateral` function. The repayer address should be `address(this)` for `_repay`.

## Impact
Mistakenly pulling user funds while the received asset shares remain stuck in the contract will result in losses for users who have sufficient allowance and balance when using the `BBLeverage.sellCollateral` functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should fix as following:
```solidity=
if (memoryData.shareOwed <= memoryData.shareOut) {
    _repay(address(this), from, memoryData.partOwed);
} else {
    //repay as much as we can
    uint256 partOut = totalBorrow.toBase(amountOut, false);
    _repay(address(this), from, partOut);
}
```

# TOFTMarketReceiverModule::leverageUpReceiver Incorrect approval handling

## Summary
leverageUpReceiver grants approval to the market on behalf of `msg.sender` before calling `IMarket::buyCollateral`. However buyCollateral expects to be approved on YieldBox shares and not TOFT directly, so the call should revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `TOFTMarketReceiverModule::leverageUpReceiver` TOFT is approved directly to the market:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/modules/TOFTMarketReceiverModule.sol#L89

However in BBLeverage/SGLLeverage:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/singularity/SGLLeverage.sol#L71

Yieldbox allowance is expected in order to withdraw to current market, and not TOFT (underlying) approval. 

## Impact
The receiver module will always revert when using `leverageUpReceiver` compose message type

## Recommendation
Deposit the current TOFT to YieldBox and approve that, instead of approving TOFT directly in `TOFTMarketReceiverModule::leverageUpReceiver`

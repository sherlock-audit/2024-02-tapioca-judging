# UsdoMarketReceiverModule::removeAssetReceiver msg_.externalData.marketHelper is unchecked enabling arbitrary market actions from magnetar

## Summary
Magnetar is an approved operator/periphery to simplify actions on user accounts. As such it has privileged access to accounts, and ensures that an unauthorized user can not access another account by using `_checkSender` checks.

However in this check any address in the cluster, is also authorized on any users account.

Unfortunately `UsdoMarketReceiverModule::removeAssetReceiver` does not check the source chain sender, and does not check a target address (`msg_.externalData.marketHelper`), which ultimately allows any user to make an arbitrary action on the behalf of any other on any market. 

## Vulnerability Detail
See that `msg_.externalData.marketHelper` is unchecked here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/usdo/modules/UsdoMarketReceiverModule.sol#L214-L216

`UsdoMarketReceiverModule::removeAssetReceiver` does not check that `msg.user == _srcChainSender`, since it ignores the _srcChainSender parameter:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/usdo/modules/UsdoReceiver.sol#L79

As a result inside Magnetar, an arbitrary call can be made on any market, on behalf of any user, by any other:

In particular, a user can make the call to removeCollateral on behalf of another, and steal his funds

## Impact
Any user can drain any other user's account

## Recommendation
Check `msg.user == _srcChainSender` and that `msg_.externalData.marketHelper` is whitelisted

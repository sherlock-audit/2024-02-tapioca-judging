# BBLeverage::sellCollateral relies on outdated interface for leverageExecutor

## Summary
BBLeverage and SGLLeverage rely on an outdated interface of `ILeverageExecutor`, so the call to `buyCollateral` and `sellCollateral` will always revert if a leverageExecutor is set.

## Vulnerability Detail
We will use `BigBang::sellCollateral` to showcase the bug, but it is applicable to `SGLLeverage/buyCollateral` as well.

In `BigBang::sellCollateral` the following call on `ILeverageExecutor::getAsset` is made:

However, the call cannot succeed since the interface has changed, as can be seen in `BaseLeverageExecutor`:

> note that `TOFTMarketReceiverModule` uses the correct version of the interface:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/TapiocaZ/contracts/tOFT/modules/TOFTMarketReceiverModule.sol#L90

## Impact
The call will always revert, and `SGLLeverage` and `BBLeverage` are unusable

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the call to have the correct interface:

```diff
- amountOut = leverageExecutor.getAsset(
-     assetId, address(collateral), address(asset), memoryData.leverageAmount, from, data
- );
+ amountOut = leverageExecutor.getAsset(
+     address(collateral), address(asset), collateralAmountIn, data
+ );
```

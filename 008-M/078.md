# `LeverageExecutor` is not working inside `BBLeverage` and `SGLeverage`

## Summary
The `buyCollateral` and `sellCollateral` functions inside the `BBLeverage` and `SGLeverage` contracts are non-functional as there is no implementation of `getCollateral` and `getAsset` in the current `LeverageExecutor` interface.


## Vulnerability Detail
[`BBLeverage::buyCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/bigBang/BBLeverage.sol#L93) and [`SGLeverage::buyCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/singularity/SGLLeverage.sol#L77) are calling `LeverageExecutor::getCollateral`. 

[`BBLeverage::sellCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/bigBang/BBLeverage.sol#L144) and [`SGLeverage::buyCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/singularity/SGLLeverage.sol#L129) are calling `LeverageExecutor::getAsset`.

However, these functions have completely different interfaces inside all the implementations of [`BaseLeverageExecutor`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/leverage/BaseLeverageExecutor.sol), e.g.
`AssetToSGLPLeverageExecutor`, `AssetTotsDaiLeverageExecutor`, `SimpleLeverageExecutor`. 

It seems in the previous versions of Tapioca `leverageExecutor` had the interface that is now expected by `BBLeverage` and `SGLeverage`. This was probably introduced during the migration to new leverageExecutor.

Neverthless, the current `buyCollateral` and `sellCollateral` functions are non-functional as there is no implementation of `getCollateral` and `getAsset` in the current `LeverageExecutor` interface. 

## Impact

The `buyCollateral` and `sellCollateral` function inside the `BBLeverage` and `SGLeverage` contracts are non-functional as there is no implementation of `getCollateral` and `getAsset` in the current `LeverageExecutor` interface.
As this is a core functionality of the leverage contracts, it is a high-severity issue.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the logic inside the `BBLeverage` and `SGLeverage` contracts to use the correct interface of `LeverageExecutor` for `getAsset` and `getCollateral` functions, and pass the correct arguments to these functions.

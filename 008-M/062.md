# The mismatch between leverage executor contracts and the utilized interface in market

## Summary
Each market (BigBang or Singularity) has a leverage executor contract to swap assets or collateral during leverage actions by calling the `getCollateral()` or `getAsset()` functions. However, the actual implementations of these functions in the leverage executor contract mismatch with the integration and interface in the market.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `BBLeverage.buyCollateral()` function, it call `leverageExecutor.getCollateral()` with 6 parameters.
```solidity=
amountOut = leverageExecutor.getCollateral(
    collateralId,
    address(asset),
    address(collateral),
    memoryData.supplyShareToAmount + memoryData.borrowShareToAmount,
    calldata_.from,
    calldata_.data
);
```
`leverageExecutor` is declared in Market contract as `ILeverageExecutor` from `tapioca-periph/interfaces/bar/ILeverageExecutor.sol`: [Market.sol#L10](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/Market.sol#L10), [Market.sol#L108](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/Market.sol#L108)

However, the actual implementation of the leverage executor contract is different, with only 4 parameters in the `getCollateral()` function. All of the SimpleLeverageExecutor, AssetToSGLPLeverageExecutor, and AssetToTSDaiLeverageExecutor contracts inherit from the BaseLeverageExecutor contract and have the `getCollateral()` function with only 4 parameters.

In BaseLeverageExecutor contract: 
```solidity=
function getCollateral(address assetAddress, address collateralAddress, uint256 assetAmountIn, bytes calldata data)
        external
        payable
        virtual
        returns (uint256 collateralAmountOut)
    {}
```
In SimpleLeverageExecutor contract:
```solidity=
function getCollateral(
    address assetAddress,
    address collateralAddress,
    uint256 assetAmountIn,
    bytes calldata swapperData
) external payable override returns (uint256 collateralAmountOut) {
    // Should be called only by approved SGL/BB markets.
    if (!cluster.isWhitelisted(0, msg.sender)) revert SenderNotValid();
    return _swapAndTransferToSender(true, assetAddress, collateralAddress, assetAmountIn, swapperData);
}
```

Therefore, those contracts are mismatch with the interface and external calls in the market, resulting in unable to use them.
The same vulnerability exist for `getAsset()` function.
## Impact
Leverage executor contracts will be unable to be used for leverage functionality (breaking core functionality)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should fix the contract implementation to match the interface used in the Market.

# StargateRouter cannot send payloads and rebalancing of ERC20s is broken

## Summary
The `Balancer.sol` contract can't perform the rebalancing of ERC20s across chains as the Stargate router is not able to send any payload and will immediately revert the transaction if a payload is included. In this instance payload is hardcoded to `"0x"`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`Balancer.sol` contract has a `rebalance` function that is supposed to perform a rebalancing of `mTOFTs` across chains. 
In case the token being transferred through Stargate is an ERC20 it is using the Stargate router to initiate the transfer.
The issue however is that the stargate router is not able to send any payload and will immediately revert the transaction if a payload is included.

If we take a look at the code, there is a payload equal to ["0x"](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/TapiocaZ/contracts/Balancer.sol#L318) being sent with the transaction:

```solidity
## Balancer.sol

    router.swap{value: msg.value}(
        _dstChainId,
        _srcPoolId,
        _dstPoolId,
        payable(this),
        _amount,
        _computeMinAmount(_amount, _slippage),
        IStargateRouterBase.lzTxObj({dstGasForCall: 0, dstNativeAmount: 0, dstNativeAddr: "0x0"}),
        _dst,
>>>>    "0x" => this is the payload that is being sent with the transaction
    );
```

As a proof of concept we can try to send a payload through the stargate router on a forked network and see that the transaction will revert.
p.s. make sure to run on it on a forked network on Ethereum mainnet.

```solidity
function testStargateRouterReverting() public {
    vm.createSelectFork(vm.envString("MAINNET_RPC_URL"));
    
    address stargateRouter = 0x8731d54E9D02c286767d56ac03e8037C07e01e98;
    address DAIWhale = 0x7A8EDc710dDEAdDDB0B539DE83F3a306A621E823;
    address DAI = 0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F;
    IStargateRouter.lzTxObj memory lzTxParams = IStargateRouter.lzTxObj(0, 0, "0x00");

    vm.startPrank(DAIWhale);
    vm.deal(DAIWhale, 5 ether);
    IERC20(DAI).approve(stargateRouter, 1e18);
    IStargateRouter(stargateRouter).swap{value: 1 ether}(
        111, 3, 3, payable(address(this)), 1e18, 1, lzTxParams, abi.encode(address(this)), "0x"
    );
}
```

It fails with the following error:

Proof of concept was tested on Ethereum network, but it applies to all the other blockchains as well. 

By looking at the Stargate documentation we can see that it is highlighted to use the `StargateComposer` instead of the `StargateRouter` if sending payloads: https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate/stargate-composability.

Both StargateRouter and StargateComposer have the `swap` interface, but the intention was to use the `StargateRouter` which can be observed by the [`retryRevert`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/dc2464f420927409a67763de6ec60fe5c028ab0e/TapiocaZ/contracts/Balancer.sol#L262-#L264) function in the `Balancer.sol` contract.

```solidity
## Balancer.sol

function retryRevert(uint16 _srcChainId, bytes calldata _srcAddress, uint256 _nonce) external payable onlyOwner {
    router.retryRevert{value: msg.value}(_srcChainId, _srcAddress, _nonce);
}
```

StargateComposer does not have the `retryRevert` function. Its code be found here: https://www.codeslaw.app/contracts/ethereum/0xeCc19E177d24551aA7ed6Bc6FE566eCa726CC8a9.

As this makes the rebalancing of `mTOFTs` broken, I'm marking this as a high-severity issue.

## Impact

Rebalancing of `mTOFTs` across chains is broken and as it is one of the main functionalities of the protocol, this is a high-severity issue.

## Recommendation
Use the `StargateComposer` instead of the `StargateRouter` if sending payloads.

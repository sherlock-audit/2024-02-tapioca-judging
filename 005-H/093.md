# leverageUpReceiver() Missing Security Check for msg_.marketHelper

## Summary
In the `TOFTMarketReceiverModule.leverageUpReceiver()` function
there is a lack of validation to verify whether the user-provided `marketHelper` is whitelisted. 
This oversight could allow malicious user to pass in a harmful `marketHelper` and construct arbitrary `calls data`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation of `TOFTMarketReceiverModule.leverageUpReceiver()` is as follows:

```solidity
    function leverageUpReceiver(bytes memory _data) public payable {
        /// @dev decode received message
        LeverageUpActionMsg memory msg_ = TOFTMsgCodec.decodeLeverageUpMsg(_data);

        /// @dev 'market'
@>      _checkWhitelistStatus(msg_.market);

        msg_.borrowAmount = _toLD(msg_.borrowAmount.toUint64());
        if (msg_.supplyAmount > 0) {
            msg_.supplyAmount = _toLD(msg_.supplyAmount.toUint64());
        }

        approve(address(msg_.market), type(uint256).max);

        {
@>          (Module[] memory modules, bytes[] memory calls) = IMarketHelper(msg_.marketHelper).buyCollateral(
                msg_.user, msg_.borrowAmount, msg_.supplyAmount, msg_.executorData
            );
            IMarket(msg_.market).execute(modules, calls, true);
        }

        approve(address(msg_.market), 0);

        emit LeverageUpReceived(msg_.user, msg_.market, msg_.borrowAmount, msg_.supplyAmount);
    }
```
As shown above, only the `market` validity is checked, but there is no validation for `marketHelper`. 
Consequently, users can provide a malicious `marketHelper` that returns harmful `modules, calls,` leading to the execution of `IMarket(msg_.market).execute(modules, calls, true);` not performing the expected `buyCollateral()` operation. 
For instance, it could execute unintended actions like `borrow/removeCollateral`.

## Impact

The introduction of a malicious `marketHelper` could result in unexpected and dangerous operations, such as `removeCollateral/borrow`.

        /// @dev decode received message
        LeverageUpActionMsg memory msg_ = TOFTMsgCodec.decodeLeverageUpMsg(_data);

        /// @dev 'market'
        _checkWhitelistStatus(msg_.market);
+       _checkWhitelistStatus(msg_.marketHelper);
```

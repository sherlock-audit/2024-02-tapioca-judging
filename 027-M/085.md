# Liquidation's caller in the market can avoid fees

## Summary
During the liquidation of the market, the target receiver will receive the collateral of the liquidated user and should transfer back to the market contract the asset tokens corresponding to the liquidated borrow amount. The excess tokens will be used to extract fees for the market. However, the caller of the liquidation can transfer the exact liquidated borrow amount, resulting in 0 excess assets.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `BBLiquidation._liquidateUser`, it triggers `_swapCollateralWithAsset` to swap collateral to obtain asset shares. `_liquidatorReceiver` address is passed by the caller, so the caller can prepare to transfer the exact borrowShare of the asset. Afterward, no fee will be extracted in the `_extractLiquidationFees` function.
```solidity=
(uint256 returnedShare,) =
    _swapCollateralWithAsset(collateralShare, _liquidatorReceiver, _liquidatorReceiverData);
if (returnedShare < borrowShare) revert AmountNotValid();

(uint256 feeShare, uint256 callerShare) = _extractLiquidationFees(returnedShare, borrowShare, callerReward);
```

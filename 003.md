# Insufficient Authorization Check Leading to Unauthorized Collateral Addition

## Summary
The **_addCollateral** function in the smart contract lacks explicit authorization checks, allowing any user to potentially add collateral on behalf of other users without their consent. Additionally, the function converts an 'amount' of collateral to a 'share' without proper validation, which could be exploited by an attacker to manipulate their collateral share unfairly.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Insufficient Authorization Check Leading to Unauthorized Collateral Addition" in the provided code is that there is no proper authorization check to ensure that only authorized users can add collateral. The function **_addCollateral** is an internal function that can be called by any other function within the smart contract, and it allows any address to add collateral without proper authorization.

This lack of authorization check means that any address can call the **_addCollateral** function and add collateral to another user's account without permission. This can lead to unauthorized manipulation of the total collateral share and potentially result in loss of funds or disruption of the system's intended behavior.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the fact that there is no proper authorization check before adding collateral to a user's account. This means that an attacker could potentially call the **_addCollateral** function and add collateral to any user's account without proper authorization.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**

1. Deploy a smart contract with the following structure:
```solidity
contract VulnerableContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) public userCollateralShare;
    uint256 public totalCollateralShare;
    address public attacker; // Attacker's address

    function _addCollateral(address from, address to, bool skim, uint256 amount, uint256 share) internal {
        if (share == 0) {
            share = yieldBox.toShare(collateralId, amount, false);
        }
        uint256 oldTotalCollateralShare = totalCollateralShare;
        userCollateralShare[to] += share;
        totalCollateralShare = oldTotalCollateralShare + share;

        _addTokens(from, to, collateralId, share, oldTotalCollateralShare, skim);

        emit LogAddCollateral(skim ? address(yieldBox) : from, to, share);
    }

    function exploit() public {
        _addCollateral(attacker, msg.sender, false, 100, 100); // Adding collateral to the caller's account
    }
}
```
2. Deploy the vulnerable contract and set the attacker's address.
3. Call the **exploit** function of the vulnerable contract. This will add collateral to the caller's account without proper authorization, exploiting the vulnerability.

By following the steps above, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the smart contract code and add collateral to any user's account without proper authorization.

## Impact
This could lead to unauthorized actions, including the dilution of other users' collateral or the unjust enrichment of the attacker's position within the contract. The combination of these issues poses a high risk of unauthorized collateral management and potential financial loss to users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code is that there is no proper authorization check before adding collateral. This means that anyone can call the **_addCollateral** function and add collateral to any address without proper permission.

To fix this issue, we need to add an authorization check to ensure that only authorized users can add collateral to a specific address. This can be achieved by adding a modifier that checks if the caller is authorized to add collateral.

Here is an example of how to fix the issue and add an authorization check:

```solidity
// Define a mapping to store authorized addresses
mapping(address => bool) authorizedAddresses;

// Modifier to check if the caller is authorized
modifier onlyAuthorized() {
    require(authorizedAddresses[msg.sender], "Unauthorized caller");
    _;
}

// Function to add authorized addresses
function addAuthorizedAddress(address _address) public {
    authorizedAddresses[_address] = true;
}

// Function to remove authorized addresses
function removeAuthorizedAddress(address _address) public {
    authorizedAddresses[_address] = false;
}

function _addCollateral(address from, address to, bool skim, uint256 amount, uint256 share) internal onlyAuthorized {
    if (share == 0) {
        share = yieldBox.toShare(collateralId, amount, false);
    }
    uint256 oldTotalCollateralShare = totalCollateralShare;
    userCollateralShare[to] += share;
    totalCollateralShare = oldTotalCollateralShare + share;

    _addTokens(from, to, collateralId, share, oldTotalCollateralShare, skim);

    emit LogAddCollateral(skim ? address(yieldBox) : from, to, share);
}
```
In this updated code, we have added a **onlyAuthorized** modifier that checks if the caller is authorized before executing the **_addCollateral** function. Additionally, we have provided functions to add and remove authorized addresses. This ensures that only authorized users can add collateral to a specific address, preventing unauthorized collateral addition.

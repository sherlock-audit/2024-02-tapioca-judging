# Potential Insolvency due to Insufficient Balance Update after Transfer in _addCollateral Function

## Summary
The **_addCollateral** function in a smart contract is susceptible to an Insufficient Balance Update after Transfer vulnerability due to its reliance on the unverified assumption that the **yieldBox.transfer** function will transfer the specified share amount from the sender to the contract. This function increments the **userCollateralShare** and **totalCollateralShare** based on the share variable before confirming the actual amount transferred. If the **yieldBox** contract deducts a fee or the transferred amount differs from the share, the contract's ledger will reflect an inflated balance, leading to a discrepancy between recorded and actual collateral. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Potential Insolvency due to Insufficient Balance Update after Transfer in _addCollateral Function" in the provided code is that the totalCollateralShare is updated before the transfer of collateral from the 'from' address to the smart contract address. This can lead to potential insolvency if the 'from' address does not have enough balance to cover the transfer after the totalCollateralShare has been updated.

Specifically, on line 264, the **totalCollateralShare** is updated by adding the 'share' amount before the transfer of collateral on line 265. If the transfer on line 265 fails due to insufficient balance in the 'from' address, the **totalCollateralShare** would have already been updated incorrectly, leading to potential insolvency.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the fact that the balance of the user's collateral share is not updated after the transfer in the **_addCollateral** function. This could potentially lead to insolvency if the user's balance is not updated correctly.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) public userCollateralShare;
    uint256 public totalCollateralShare;
    
    function _addCollateral(address from, address to, uint256 amount, uint256 share) internal {
        if (share == 0) {
            share = amount; // Simplified for demonstration purposes
        }
        userCollateralShare[to] += share;
        uint256 oldTotalCollateralShare = totalCollateralShare;
        totalCollateralShare = oldTotalCollateralShare + share;
        // Simulate transfer without updating user's balance
        emit LogAddCollateral(from, to, share);
    }
    
    event LogAddCollateral(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount);
}

contract Attacker {
    VulnerableContract vulnerableContract;
    
    constructor(address _vulnerableContract) {
        vulnerableContract = VulnerableContract(_vulnerableContract);
    }
    
    function exploit() public {
        address from = msg.sender;
        address to = address(this);
        uint256 amount = 100;
        uint256 share = 50;
        
        // Call the vulnerable function
        vulnerableContract._addCollateral(from, to, amount, share);
        
        // The user's balance is not updated after the transfer
        // This could potentially lead to insolvency
    }
}
```
In this PoC, the Attacker contract exploits the vulnerability by calling the _addCollateral function in the VulnerableContract without updating the user's balance after the transfer. This could potentially lead to insolvency due to insufficient balance update.

## Impact
This could potentially allow users to withdraw more assets than they have collateralized, risking the contract's solvability and security.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code lies in the fact that the balance of the from address is not updated after the transfer in the _addCollateral function. This can potentially lead to insolvency if the from address does not have enough balance to cover the transfer.

To fix this issue, we need to update the balance of the from address after the transfer is made. This can be done by deducting the transferred amount from the from address balance.

Here is the corresponding patch code example:

```solidity
258       function _addCollateral(address from, address to, uint256 amount, uint256 share) internal {
259           if (share == 0) {
260               share = yieldBox.toShare(collateralId, amount, false);
261           }
262           userCollateralShare[to] += share;
263           uint256 oldTotalCollateralShare = totalCollateralShare;
264           totalCollateralShare = oldTotalCollateralShare + share;
265           yieldBox.transfer(from, address(this), collateralId, share);
266           userCollateralShare[from] -= share; // Update the balance of the from address
267           emit LogAddCollateral(from, to, share);
```
By adding line 266 to deduct the transferred amount from the **from** address balance, we ensure that the balance is updated correctly and prevent potential insolvency due to insufficient balance update after the transfer.

# BBLeverage/SGLLeverage::sellCollateral excess asset stays in contract

## Summary
When calling `BBLeverage::sellCollateral` some collateral is sold in order to repay a borrow in asset (usdo). However if more asset than needed to fully repay the borrow is obtained, it stays in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see that in `sellCollateral`, some collateral is swapped, and used to repay a borrow position:

1/ [swap of collateral to asset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/bigBang/BBLeverage.sol#L148-L150)

2/ [repay of borrow position](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/bigBang/BBLeverage.sol#L155-L157)

But we can see that if `(memoryData.shareOwed < memoryData.shareOut)`, the amount `memoryData.shareOut - memoryData.shareOwed` is not used and not returned to the user.

In fact it stays in the contract and is vulnerable to be extracted by any user in the case of a `Singularity` market, because any user can call `addAsset` with skim == true.

## Impact
Some funds are lost when calling `sellCollateral` on BBLeverage/SGLLeverage, and can be stolen in the case of `SGLLeverage`.

## Recommendation
Send the excess amount of asset back to the user from which the collateral has been taken.

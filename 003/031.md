# BBLeverage::buyCollateral Malicious operator can abuse _allowedBorrow approval on Big bang market

## Summary
buyCollateral enables a user to deleverage a borrow position on a BigBang market. However in the case an operator uses an user allowance to carry the operation on the user behalf, he can abuse the approval to make the user transfer an arbitrary amount (within the limits of a yieldbox approval to the market). 

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see that the `_allowedBorrow` is checked at the end of [buyCollateral](
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/bigBang/BBLeverage.sol#L108)

However it fails to account that the operator controls slippage incurred [here](
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/bigBang/BBLeverage.sol#L93-L100)

And thus even though `_allowedBorrow` is checked, an arbitrarily big amount can be pulled [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/bigBang/BBLeverage.sol#L78) provided the user has an unlimited approval of the yield box contract to the big bang market.

It is worth to be noted that unlimited approvals are common among users wanting to save on gas.

It is also worth to be noted that the malicious operator has to be approved for some amount of borrow by the user because of this [condition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/bigBang/BBLeverage.sol#L107)

### Scenario
Alice has approved operator Bob for 1 wei of borrow on ETH BigBang market.

Bob can call `buyCollateral` on behalf of Alice, specifying an arbitrary `calldata_.supplyAmount` which will use Alice's unlimited approval of yieldBox usdo asset [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-tapioca/blob/main/Tapioca-bar/contracts/markets/bigBang/BBLeverage.sol#L78), then swap it using `getCollateral` and ensure the `amountOut` to be 1 wei (can use a malicious token on the swap path).

As a result all of the checks have passed, but Alice is drained of her usdo

## Impact
allowedBorrow allowance can be abused by a malicious operator to steal tokens from users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an additional check against an oracle to not incur excessive slippage in the `getCollateral` swap

Alternatively, consider to spend lending allowance when pulling usdo instead of spending borrow allowance when providing collateral

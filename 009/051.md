# SGL Liquidation Fees be Locked in Penrose

## Summary
During the execution of `SGL._extractLiquidationFees()`, the `LiquidationFees` are directly stored in the `penrose` contract. However, the `penrose` contract does not offer any method to handle these fees already present within it.

## Vulnerability Detail
When `SGL` undergoes liquidation, the `_extractLiquidationFees()` function stores the `LiquidationFees` in the `penrose` contract. 
The code implementation is as follows:
`_liquidateUser()`->`_extractLiquidationFees()`
```solidity
    function _extractLiquidationFees(uint256 extraShare, uint256 callerReward)
        private
        returns (uint256 feeShare, uint256 callerShare)
    {
        callerShare = (extraShare * callerReward) / FEE_PRECISION; //  y%  of profit goes to caller.
        feeShare = extraShare - callerShare; // rest goes to the fee

        if (feeShare > 0) {
            uint256 feeAmount = yieldBox.toAmount(assetId, feeShare, false);
@>          yieldBox.depositAsset(assetId, address(this), address(penrose), feeAmount, 0);
        }
        if (callerShare > 0) {
            uint256 callerAmount = yieldBox.toAmount(assetId, callerShare, false);
            yieldBox.depositAsset(assetId, address(this), msg.sender, callerAmount, 0);
        }
    }
```
However, the `penrose` contract lacks any method to process these fees that are already within it. 
Even the `penrose.withdrawAllMarketFees()` function cannot handle these fees already residing in the `penrose` contract. Consequently, this portion of fees remains locked within the `penrose` contract.

## Impact
The SGL Liquidation Fees will remain locked in the `penrose` contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommendation: It is advisable to introduce a method to transfer this portion of fees to `twTap`

```diff
+    function distributeBalanceOnTwTap(address _asset,uint256 _assetId) external onlyOwner notPaused {
+       uint256 feeShares = yieldBox.balanceOf(address(this), _assetId);
+       (uint256 feeAmount ,_ ) = yieldBox.withdraw(_assetId, address(this), address(this), 0, feeShares);
+       uint256 rewardTokenId = twTap.rewardTokenIndex(_asset);
+       _distributeOnTwTap(feeAmount, rewardTokenId, _asset, twTap);
+    }
```
